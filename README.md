#### Project Description
The Insurance Prediction project aims to predict medical costs using the "Medical Cost Personal Datasets" obtained from Kaggle. The analysis involves performing multiple linear regression based on variables selected through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

#### Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Acquired the dataset from Kaggle, which includes information on various factors affecting medical costs.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted thorough EDA to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the dataset.
   - Selected relevant variables for the multiple linear regression analysis.

3. **Multiple Linear Regression:**
   - Implemented a multiple linear regression model to predict medical costs based on the selected variables.
   - Evaluated the model's performance and assessed the significance of predictors.
